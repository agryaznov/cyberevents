# cyberEvents: offline educational protocol

## Vision
By this paper we define a simple protocol for offline educational content creators, producers and consumers. Using this protocol content creators can maximise results of their offline efforts without any intermediaries. Creators enable automagic production and distribution by donating part of revenue to content producers thus those who can not afford offline participation will still can enjoy high quality educational content online distributed through ipfs.

## Introduction
Key problem we want to address is to enable free educational content that produced as side product of high quality educational events. Our observation is that good teachers are able to sell their courses with quite high margin not because there is no way to get educational content from them, but because there are enough consumers who enjoy to pay for personal contact with sensei. In all such cases part of the margin is eaten by payment processors, event platforms and institutions. This margin can be donated to professional producers who will open source educational content thus creating evergrowing library of fresh and high quality knowledge.
